# grow-a-garden-api

A fast and easy way to access grow a garden data via a RESTful API. The data is fetched from [growagarden.gg](https://growagarden.gg) which allows us to operate without using bots or manual labour. This helps provide the most comprehensive local setup.

Note that this API is not affiliated with growagarden.gg and is not endorsed by them. It is a community-driven project to provide easy access to the data.

Additionally this API was inspired by the [growagarden api](https://github.com/Just3itx/Grow-A-Garden-API/tree/main) by [Just3itx](https://github.com/Just3itx) which had issues with how it was slow at fetching the data.
