This API is a fast and easy way to access grow a garden data via a RESTful API. The data is fetched from [growagarden.gg](https://growagarden.gg) which allows us to operate without using bots or manual labour. This helps provide the most comprehensive local setup.

### How it works?
Under the hood, the API uses [nextjs](https://nextjs.org/)'s `unstable_cache` function to cache the data for how much time there is left before the we would need to invalidate the cache (typically if its stock, we would invalidate it after each restock)
